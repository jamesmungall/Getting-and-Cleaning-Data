MySQL connection
========================================================

I have had to add the ip address of this computer to site5 admin -> Databases -> remote access MySQL -> add new host
  On 10th June 2015 this was 90.244.198.25

Then I can connect.
```{r}
jamesmungallDb <- dbConnect(MySQL(),user="jamesmun_site2", password="23lkj43",host="jamesmungall.co.uk")                    
result <- dbGetQuery(jamesmungallDb,"show databases;"); dbDisconnect(jamesmungallDb);
```

```{r}
chemBackup <- dbConnect(MySQL(),user="jamesmun_site2", password="23lkj43",host="jamesmungall.co.uk",  db="jamesmun_chemistryBackup")
allTables <- dbListTables(chemBackup)
length(allTables)
```

```{r}
dbListFields(chemBackup,"j25_content")
dbGetQuery(chemBackup, "select count(*) from j25_content")
j25_contentData <- dbReadTable(chemBackup, "j25_content")
View(j25_contentData)
```

```{r}
query <- dbSendQuery(chemBackup, "select * from j25_content where hits between 1000 and 3000")
hitsQuery <- fetch(query)
